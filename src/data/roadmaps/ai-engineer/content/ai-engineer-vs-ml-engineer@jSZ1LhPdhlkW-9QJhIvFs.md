# AI Engineer vs ML Engineer

An AI Engineer and an ML Engineer have overlapping roles but distinct areas of focus within the AI ecosystem. An AI Engineer typically works on building and integrating comprehensive AI solutions, which can include natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and intelligent automation systems, utilizing a combination of machine learning, deep learning, and rule-based AI techniques. They focus on creating end-to-end systems that can simulate human-like capabilities. In contrast, an ML Engineer specializes more narrowly on designing, training, and optimizing machine learning models, ensuring they perform efficiently and are integrated into production environments. While both roles require a deep understanding of algorithms and data, AI Engineers work on broader applications, combining various AI technologies, whereas ML Engineers are more concerned with the underlying models and their scalability.
