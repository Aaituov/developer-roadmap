# Supabase

Supabase is an open-source backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform that provides developers with a suite of tools to build scalable web and mobile applications quickly. It offers features like a managed PostgreSQL database, real-time data synchronization, authentication, and storage, making it easy to set up and manage backend infrastructure without extensive coding. Supabase also includes APIs for interacting with the database, enabling developers to focus on building front-end features while relying on a robust, scalable backend. Its simplicity, open-source nature, and integration with modern development frameworks make it an attractive alternative to services like Firebase, especially for projects that prioritize control over data and flexibility.
