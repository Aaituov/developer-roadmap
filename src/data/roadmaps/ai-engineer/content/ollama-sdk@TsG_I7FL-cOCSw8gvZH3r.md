# Ollama SDK

The Ollama SDK is a toolkit that enables developers to integrate and run large language models (LLMs) locally on personal devices or within applications. It provides APIs and utilities for deploying, managing, and interacting with models directly on laptops, desktops, or edge devices without needing cloud-based processing. The SDK simplifies the integration of AI capabilities, allowing developers to build applications for tasks like text generation, summarization, and question answering while maintaining data privacy and reducing latency.
