# Audio Processing

Audio processing refers to the analysis, manipulation, and transformation of audio signals using algorithms and computational techniques. In AI engineering, it involves tasks like speech recognition, sound classification, and audio enhancement, often utilizing machine learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Applications include voice assistants, music analysis, noise cancellation, and speech-to-text systems.
