# Image Understanding

Image understanding is the ability of AI models to analyze and interpret visual content, recognizing objects, scenes, and patterns within images. It involves tasks like object detection, classification, and segmentation, using techniques such as CNNs and Vision Transformers. Applications include autonomous driving, medical imaging, and content moderation, where accurate visual perception is essential.
