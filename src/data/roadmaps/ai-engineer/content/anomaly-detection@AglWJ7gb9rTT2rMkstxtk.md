# Anomaly Detection

Anomaly detection is the process of identifying data points, events, or behaviors that significantly deviate from the norm or expected patterns within a dataset. In AI engineering, it involves using statistical, machine learning, or deep learning techniques to detect outliers, fraud, network intrusions, or equipment failures. Common methods include clustering, statistical models, and neural networks, which can be applied in real-time or on historical data across various industries such as finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity.
