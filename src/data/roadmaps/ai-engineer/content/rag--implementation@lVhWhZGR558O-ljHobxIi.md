# RAG & Implementation

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI technique that combines information retrieval with language generation to create more accurate and contextually relevant responses. It involves two main components: a retriever and a generator. The retriever searches a large database or knowledge base to find relevant documents or information based on a query, while the generator uses this retrieved information to generate a coherent, informed response. To implement RAG, you typically need a retrieval model (e.g., based on embeddings and vector search) and a generative language model (like GPT). The process starts by converting the query into embeddings, retrieving the most relevant documents using a vector database, and then passing these documents along with the query to the language model. The model combines this information to generate an accurate and context-aware response. This technique helps create AI systems that can provide more reliable and detailed answers by grounding responses in real-world data.
