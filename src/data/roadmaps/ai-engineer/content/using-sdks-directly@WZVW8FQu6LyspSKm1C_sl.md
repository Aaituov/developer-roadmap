# Using SDKs Directly

Using SDKs directly to implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) allows developers to seamlessly integrate retrieval and generation components into their applications. SDKs provide pre-built functions for tasks like vector search, data indexing, and language model interaction, simplifying the process of setting up and managing RAG systems. By using an SDK, developers can efficiently handle retrieval operations (e.g., querying a vector database) and connect them with generative models to produce context-aware responses.
