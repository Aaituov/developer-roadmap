# Indexing Embeddings

Indexing embeddings for vector search involves organizing dense vector representations of data (like text or images) into a searchable structure that allows efficient retrieval based on similarity. In vector search, embeddings are indexed using techniques like clustering or tree-based methods, enabling fast, approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) searches. This allows systems to quickly find and retrieve items that are semantically similar to a query, even in large datasets.
