# Inference

Inference in AI Engineering refers to the process of using a trained machine learning model to make predictions or generate outputs based on new input data. It involves applying the model to unseen data to derive results, such as classifying images, generating text, or recognizing speech. Unlike the training phase, which involves learning patterns from data, inference focuses on utilizing the learned patterns to deliver fast and accurate predictions.
