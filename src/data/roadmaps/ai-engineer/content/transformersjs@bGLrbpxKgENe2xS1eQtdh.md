# Transformers.js

Transformers.js is a JavaScript library that brings transformer models, like those from Hugging Face, to the browser or Node.js environments, enabling on-device machine learning without relying on cloud-based services. It allows developers to run tasks such as text generation, sentiment analysis, and translation directly in a web application or server-side script. By leveraging WebAssembly (Wasm) and efficient JavaScript implementations, Transformers.js provides a way to integrate powerful NLP capabilities with minimal latency, enhanced privacy, and offline functionality. This makes it ideal for building interactive, real-time applications where running models locally is crucial for performance and data security.
