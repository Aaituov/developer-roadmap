# Manual Implementation

Manual implementation often involves using tools and functions that allow developers to define specific functions or actions that an AI model can invoke, providing a structured way to extend the model's capabilities. For example, OpenAI's Function Calling enables developers to describe functions to the model, allowing it to generate JSON inputs for these functions based on user queries. This approach helps in guiding the AI's responses, handling specific tasks, and ensuring more controlled and reliable outputs. Similarly, Vercel's AI SDK offers a set of tools for building AI-powered applications, allowing for seamless integration of AI capabilities into web applications.
