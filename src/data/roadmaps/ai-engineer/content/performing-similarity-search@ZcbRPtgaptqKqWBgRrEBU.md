# Performing Similarity Search

Performing a similarity search involves comparing data points (such as text, images, or embeddings) to find items that are most similar to a given query. This is typically done using vector representations, where data is converted into dense vectors (embeddings), and the similarity is measured using metrics like cosine similarity or Euclidean distance. Similarity searches are used in applications like recommendation systems, document retrieval, and image recognition, where the goal is to find items that closely match the user's input based on semantic or visual similarities.
