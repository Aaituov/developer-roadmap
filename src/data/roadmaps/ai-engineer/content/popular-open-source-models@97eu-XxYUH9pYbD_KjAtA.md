# Popular Open Source Models

Popular open-source models include BERT for NLP tasks like text classification and question answering, GPT-Neo and GPT-J as alternatives to GPT-3 for text generation, and Stable Diffusion for creating images from text descriptions. CLIP connects text and images, enabling tasks like image search, while Whisper handles speech recognition for transcription and translation. FastText offers efficient text classification, especially for low-resource languages. These models provide versatile, flexible solutions for a range of applications across natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition.
