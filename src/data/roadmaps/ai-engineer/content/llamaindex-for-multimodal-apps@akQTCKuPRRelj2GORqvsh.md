# LlamaIndex for Multimodal Apps

LlamaIndex enables multimodal apps by linking language models (LLMs) to diverse data sources, including text and images. It indexes and retrieves information across formats, allowing LLMs to process and integrate data from multiple modalities. This supports applications like visual question answering, content summarization, and interactive systems by providing structured, context-aware inputs from various content types.
